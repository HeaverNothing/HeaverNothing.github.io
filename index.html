							<h2 class="title" id="aboutme">About Me</h2>
							<h5 class="description"> I am a Systems Engineer Based out of Leamington Spa in the UK. I moved here
								after completing my Masters in Electronic and Computer Engineering at the University of
								Limerick, Ireland.<br>
								I have experience in working in Systems Engineering (MBSE), Autonomous Vehicles (ADAS),
								Electrical Vehicles, SOTIF and 5G Events.<br>
								I also have experience using programs and programming languages such as SysML, AutoCAD,
								SolidWorks, Vivado, MatLab, Verilog, Java, Gerrit, Python, C, Kafka, SQL, PHP, and more.<br>
								I grew up interested in building my own computers and coding on them, which helped me decide
								which field of engineering I would pursue.<br>
								I am a massive car enthusiast that has been fortunate enough to go to The Nurburgring, 24hrs of
								Les Mans, WRC and many more motorsport events.<br>
								My other passions also lay in speciality coffee and competing in powerlifting at an
								international level.<br>

									<h4 class="info-title">Coffee</h4>
									<p>I developed a keen interest in coffee after going to see my brother in Birmingham in
										2017.
										This was where he introduced me to specialty coffee even though, at the time, I didn't
										drink coffee.
										That Christmas he bought me an Aeropress just so he doesn't have to bring his own home
										(passing it off as a present was pretty smart). Since then I have bought my own espresso
										machine,
										went to coffee competitions, read books, made friends with cafe owners and coffee
										roasters
										and generally just been fascinated by all types of specialty coffee. <br>
										I hope that in time I can use my engineering knowledge in combination with coffee.

									<h4 class="info-title">Powerlifting</h4>
									<p>In April 2015 my brother convinced a skinny nerd 16-year-old me to build a home gym, even
										though at the time I thought it was a waste of my money but I am glad he did. Back then
										I was barely able to squat my own body weight, since then I have been progressing
										steadily. After realising that I liked seeing the weight on the bar increase more than
										my own body weight, I decided to give powerlifting a try - a sport divided by age and
										weight aiming to see who can squat, bench and deadlift the most.<br>
										In September 2016 I did my first competition, since then I have competed at a national
										level and even been fortunate enough to represent Ireland as an Under 66kg Under 23
										lifter at the world championship in Helsingborg Sweden in 2019. In 2021 after not
										competing in nearly 2 years I represented Ireland again at the world championship. I was
										fortunate to come back with a bronze medal. A few months later at the European
										championship in Västerås Sweden, I was fortunate enough to win - winning by body weight
										(217.5kg squat (NR), 127.5 kg bench & 242.5 kg deadlift, total 587.5kg (NR) at 64.2 kg).
										<br>
										It is great to see my constant training and commitment for the past 5 years has finally
										paid off with me reaching a bucket list goal of "Be successful at an international level
										at something". I am already looking forward to when I get the opportunity to represent
										my country again.

									<h4 class="info-title">Cars</h4>
									<p>For as long as I can remember I have always been into cars. In my childhood, Discovery
										Turbo & old reruns of Top Gear were constantly on rotation in the house. Most
										conversations at the dinner table in our house revolve around variations of our dream
										garages (GT3 Touring, GR Yaris & Range Rover Classic (EV Conversion) for me as of late)
										or whatever new car has come out. This passion is shared with my dad and my brother so
										much that we have been to a lot of motorsport events such as Goodwood, 24 hours of Le
										Mans, WRC Germany, and 6 hours of Nürburgring.<br>
										I hope in the coming years my dad, brother and I can finally tick off going see an F1
										race in person off our collective bucklists.

										lead to not meeting automotive standards and regulations.
										I learned about the facets of functional safety including; SOTIF, ISO26262 Standards and

										I am constantly trying to better myself. After building my first PC when I was 11
										I joined my local CoderDojo in Athlone to learn how to code. It was here that I first
										learned HTML & CSS.
										This has allowed me to create sites for people such as
										<a href="https://www.andynevinfitness.com/" target="_blank">Andy Nevin</a> who has
										several thousand visits per week. It has also allowed me to create this site. I have
										also used
										websites such as Udemy to learn PHP, Java,
										<a href="assets/certs/udemy_python.jpg" target="_blank">Python</a> & C.
										I have also used online sites to learn Microsoft Office Specialist Certification in
