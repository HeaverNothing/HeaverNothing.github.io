                    <h5 class="description"> I am a student in the University of Limerick studying a Masters in Electronic and Computer Engineering.
                        My background in electronics & electrical switchgear panels has given me a solid
                        base on which to expand on. I have grown up with an interest in building
                        my own computers and coding on them which helped me decide which field of engineering
                        I would pursue. Since I also have a big interest in motorsport, speciality coffee & powerlifting.

                            <h4 class="info-title">Coffee</h4>
                            <p>I have a keen interest in coffee after going to see my brother in Birmingham in 2017, where he introduced me to speciality
                                coffee, even though I didn't drink coffee. That Christmas he bought me an Aeropress just
                                so he doesn't have to bring his own home (passing it off as a present was pretty smart).
                                Since then I have bought my own espresso machine, went to coffee competitions, read books and
                                generally just been fascinated by all types of speciality coffee. <br>
                                I hope that in time I can use my engineering knowledge in combination with coffee.

                            <p>In April 2015 my brother convinced a skinny nerd 16 year old me to build a home gym,
                                even though at the time I thought it was a waste of my money but I am glad he did.
                                Back then I was barely able to squat my own bodyweight, since then I have been progressing
                                steadily. <br>
                                In September 2016 I did my first competition, since then I have competed at a national
                                level and even been fortunate enough to represent Ireland as a Under 66kg Under 23 lifter at
                                the world championship in Helsingborg Sweden in 2019. In 2021 after not competing in nearly
                                2 years I represented Ireland again. I was fortunate to comeback with a bronze medal and a national
                                record for squatting 210kg.
                                <br>
                                It is great to see my constant training and commitment for the past 5 years has finally
                                paid off with me reaching a bucket list goal of "Be successful at an international level at something".
                                I am already looking forward to when I get the opportunity to represent my country again.

                            <p>As long as I can remember I have always been into cars. In my childhood Discovery Turbo &
                                Top Gear were constantly on rotation in the house. Most conversations revolves around the
                                dream garage (GT3 RS, RS4 & Range Rover Sport SVR for me) or whatever new car has come out.
                                This passion is shared with my dad and my brother we have been the a lot of motorsport events
                                such as Goodwood, 24 hours of Le Mans, WRC Germany, 6 hours of Nürburgring. <br>
                                I hope in the coming year by dad, brother and I can finally go see an F1 race in person.

                                   I am constantly trying to better myself. After building my first PC when I was 11
                                    I joined my local CoderDojo in Athlone to learn how to code. It was here that I first learned HTML & CSS.
                                    This has allowed me to create sites for people such as
                                    <a href="https://www.andynevinfitness.com/" target="_blank">Andy Nevin</a> which has several
                                    thousand visits per week. It has also allowed me to create this site. I have also used
                                    websites such as Udemy to learn PHP, Java,
                                    <a href="assets/certs/udemy_python.jpg" target="_blank">Python</a> & C.
                                    I have also used online sites learn Microsoft Office Specialist Certification in
                                    <a href="assets/certs/udemy_excel.jpg" target="_blank">Excel, </a>

                                    Through my work and university I have also learned AUTOCAD Electrical, MATLAB, Simulink,

                    Coventry, UK. I got this position after completing the JLR Tech quest - a set of online challenges that
                    used your tech savviness abilities to figure out clues.<br>
                    I worked in the IPMA team - a subset of the Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems section of electrical engineering.
                    I was working on the current and next generation camera (also know as Forward looking camera) for ADAS features
                    such as Automatic Emergency Braking, Lane Keep Assist, Adaptive Cruise Control, Traffic Sign Recognition, Blind
                    Spot Assist, Park Assist and Adaptive High Beam.<br>

                    I was tasked with making sure RTC (A defect dashboard) showed the current state of IPMA software releases and current
                    position of all related defects.<br>
                    End Of Line Calibration<br>
                    Find possible noise factors for the IPMA units calibration at the end of line WAHA rigs. Find all the noise factors,
                    and adjust the position of the IPMA target to suit the updated values.<br>

                    Update the Bill of Design document for the new generation camera. The document shows everything about the IPMA unit
